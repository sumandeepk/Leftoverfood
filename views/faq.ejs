                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>The World Food Summit of 1996 defined food security as existing "when all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life". Commonly, the concept of food security is defined as including both physical and economic access to food that meets people's dietary needs as well as their food preferences. In many countries, health problems related to dietary excess are an ever increasing threat. In fact, malnutrition and food borne diarrhea are becoming a double burden.

Food security is built on three pillars:

Food availability: sufficient quantities of food available on a consistent basis.
Food access: having sufficient resources to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious diet.
Food use: appropriate use based on knowledge of basic nutrition and care, as well as adequate water and sanitation.
Food security is a complex sustainable development issue, linked to health through malnutrition, but also to sustainable economic development, environment, and trade. There is a great deal of debate around food security with some arguing that:

There is enough food in the world to feed everyone adequately; the problem is distribution.
Future food needs can - or cannot - be met by current levels of production.
National food security is paramount - or no longer necessary because of global trade.
Globalization may - or may not - lead to the persistence of food insecurity and poverty in rural communities.
Issues such as whether households get enough food, how it is distributed within the household and whether that food fulfills the nutrition needs of all members of the household show that food security is clearly linked to health..</p>

                    <p>Yes. C Corporations can deduct the lesser of half of gross profit (loss) or base cost of donated food from their taxable income (IRC Section 170).
